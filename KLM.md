To estimate the time saved with the new design by applying a Keystroke Level Model (KLM), we need to analyze the actions required in the current and proposed designs and estimate the time it takes for each action. KLM is a simplified model for predicting the time it takes to perform a series of actions based on the cognitive and motor components involved in those actions. It uses "keystrokes" as a unit of time, where one keystroke represents a specific time duration (usually around 0.1 seconds).
